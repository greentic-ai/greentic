## üìù Introduction

Greentic AI is an open-source platform designed to let you build, deploy, and manage agentic workflows at lightning speed.  
- **Fastest** runtime with zero cold-starts for WebAssembly tools.  
- **Extendable** architecture: plug in your own channels, tools, and processes.  
- **Secure** by design: sandboxed Wasm allows to securely run untrusted third-party MCP tools.
- **Observability** via OpenTelemetry integrations

---

## üîë Key Concepts

### Tools (MCP in Wasm)

- **MCP** (Micro-Connector Process) modules compile to WebAssembly.  
- Each tool exposes a simple API:  
  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "weather_api",
    "action": "forecast_weather",
    "parameters": { "q": "London", "days": 3 }
  }
  ```
- Tools run in a sandbox, ensuring resource limits and security.

### Channels

- **Channels** let your flows send and receive messages to the outside world.  
- Examples: Telegram, Slack, HTTP webhooks, databases.  
- Define a channel in your config:
  ```toml
  [[channels]]
  name = "telegram"
  type = "telegram_bot"
  token = "TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
  ```

### Processes - (Coming Soon)

- **Processes** encapsulate business logic and control flow (conditionals, retries, loops).  

### Agents (Coming Soon)

- **Agents** will be LLM-driven ‚Äúsuper-processes‚Äù that can plan, learn, and adapt.  
- Stay tuned for:
  - Prompt management  
  - Memory & context handling  
  - Autonomous decision loops

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Greentic CLI**  
   ```bash
   cargo install greentic (coming soon, for now do cargo run)
   ```
2. **Initialize one time **  
   ```bash
   greentic init
   ```
3. **Manage your flows**  (coming soon)
   ```bash
   greentic flow validate my_flow.greentic
   greentic flow deploy my_flow.greentic
   greentic flow start/stop my_flow.greentic
   greentic channel pull telegram
   greentic channel start/stop telegram
   greentic tool pull weather_api
   greentic tool start/stop weather_api 
   ```

## üõ† Quick Flow Example

```json
{
  "id": "sample-weather-flow",
  "description": "Fetch and relay weather forecasts",
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "telegram",
      "config": {
        "token": "TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "weather_api",
      "wasm": "weather_api.wasm"
    }
  ],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "weather_in",
      "channel": "telegram",
      "in": true
    },
    {
      "id": "forecast",
      "tool": "weather_api.forecast_weather",
      "parameters": {
        "q": "{{weather_in.payload.location}}",
        "days": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "weather_out",
      "channel": "telegram",
      "out": true
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "from": "weather_in",
      "to": "forecast"
    },
    {
      "from": "forecast",
      "to": "weather_out"
    }
  ]
}
```

Start your flow: (coming soon)
```bash
# validate the flow is ok
greentic flow validate ./sample-weather-flow
# deploy the flow (only needs to happen one time)
greentic flow deploy ./sample-weather-flow
# start your flow
greentic flow start sample-weather-flow
```

Stop your flow:
```bash
greentic flow stop sample-weather-flow
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Controlling Flows, Channels & Tools (Coming soon)

### Start / Stop a Flow

```bash
# Start
greentic flow start <flow-id>

# Stop
greentic flow stop <flow-id>
```

### Start / Stop a Channel

```bash
#
# Start
greentic channel start <channel-name>

# Stop
greentic channel stop <channel-name>
```

## üî≠ Coming Soon

- **Agents**: autonomous LLM-backed actors  

If there is demand:
- **Process Library**: pre-built workflows (e.g., PR triage, sales outreach)  
- **UI Dashboard**: visual flow designer and monitor
