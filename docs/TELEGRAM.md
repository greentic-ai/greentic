# ü§ñ How to Create a Telegram Bot and Get Your `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`

To use the Telegram channel in Greentic, you'll need a **Telegram Bot Token**, known as `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`. You can generate it in under 2 minutes using **BotFather**, Telegram's official bot management interface.

### 2. Create a New Bot

Type the command:  
```
/newbot
```

BotFather will ask you to give your bot a **name** and a **username**. The name is what users see; the username must end in `bot`, e.g. `weather_helper_bot`.

You'll receive a response like:

### 3. Copy Your Token

BotFather will respond with something like:
```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at telegram.me/your_bot.
Use this token to access the HTTP API:
123456789:ABCDEF_your_real_token_here
```

üîê **Copy the token** ‚Äî this is your `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.
